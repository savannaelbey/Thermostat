# Thermostat

Project incomplete.

## Specifications:

- Thermostat starts at 20 degrees</br>
- You can increase the temperature with an up function</br>
- You can decrease the temperature with a down function</br>
- The minimum temperature is 10 degrees</br>
- If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees</br>
- If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees</br>
- Power saving mode is on by default but it can also be turned off</br>
- You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function</br>
- You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is low-usage, <= 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage.</br>
(In the challenges where we add an interface, low-usage will be indicated with green, medium-usage indicated with black, high-usage indicated with red.)</br>
